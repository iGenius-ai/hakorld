              <p>Let’s start building DEF CON 31 a little early this year. Like, right now. DEF CON 31’s General Call for Ideas opens today.<br><br>

              It’s a General Call because we’re open to ideas for Contests, Events, Villages, Vendors, Entertainment and anything else you’ve got on your mind to take DC31 up a notch.<br><br>

              It’s also General because this doesn’t replace the formal call that comes later in the year - hopefully instead it streamlines all those formal calls when they come down.<br><br>

              If you were a content creator for DEF CON 30, we especially want to hear from you. That’s everybody - Contests, Villages, Events, Musicians - everybody. This will allow us to discuss your pre-approval for DC31, and allow approved content creators to have a much longer runway. This should improve the experience for all concerned, with less pressure close to the deadline and more time to work out any logistical issues.<br><br>

              Also, we’re planning on bringing back DEF CON Kids for DC31. We’re focusing on content conceived and created by kids to share with other kids. We’re eager to hear everyone’s ideas, especially from kids and DEF CON content creators with experience in kid friendly activities.<br><br>

              So send your answers to the questions below to info@defcon.org, and let’s jump start this thing! August will be here before you know it.<br><br>

              <strong>----- Start of Form ------</strong><br><br>

              Who are you?<br>
              How can we contact you?<br><br>

              What do you want to do at DEF CON 31?<br>
              Please describe it as best you can, provide link to examples, etc <br>
              Why would an attendee be interested? Give us the pitch. <br><br>
              Tell us about your past DEF CON experiences that have made you want to volunteer your time at DEF CON to do this.<br>
              If you've been previously accepted (Village/contest, etc), do you have something that's new for DC31 we should discuss or help promote? Are there any immediate notes or things you need us to change to help you this year. <br><br>
              <strong>----- End of Form ------</strong></p>
